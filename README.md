# BachelorScriptie
Code for my bachelor thesis project on automated generation of a volumetric mesh from multiple polygonal meshes.

This is a Python 3.7 script made for Blender. Open and run this script in Blender and it will automatically try
to approximate the 3D volume between two or multiple triangular meshes.
